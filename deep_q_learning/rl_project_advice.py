If you're interested in doing your own Insight project in RL, here are some helpful starting points:

**Resources:**
For additional background, here are some great resources:
- Spinning up in Deep RL by OpenAI: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/
- Berkeley Deep RL Course:
- DQN tutorials

**Project ideas:**


**Components of a Reinforcement Learning project:**

In most reinforcement learning projects, you'll need to decide on each of the following.

- Environment:

Whereas supervised learning has long had established benchmark datasets such as ImageNet, reinforcement learning...

 OpenAI gym is a standardized , so they serve as useful benchmarks.

 In addition, OpenAI gym gives us a spectrum from very easy environments to complicated environments,

 When reinforcement learning algorithms fail to learn, they generally fail silently with the only sign of trouble being that...they never solve the game.

- What to learn:
    The most common reinforcement learning algorithms generally learn one of the following:
    - Policies (stochastic or deterministic)
    - Action-value functions
    - Value functions
    - Environment models


- Architecture
- Learning - stochastic gradient descent
- Evaluation Metric
- Hyperparameters (?)
