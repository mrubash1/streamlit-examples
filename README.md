# Streamlit Example Reports for Insight
Welcome! In this repo, we walk you through examples of two projects.
Each project is broken into four parts, which correspond roughly to the four
weeks of an Insight session.

1. ðŸŽ¬ **[Movie Recommendation](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-examples/tree/master/movie_recs)**:
In this project, we build a movie recommendation system together (inspired by Amber Robertâ€™s
[Project Orient](https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/Project-Orient)).
Here is a snapshot of what youâ€™ll create:
[Week1](http://share.streamlit.io/0.23.0-2EMF1/index.html?id=F5rVwqPj43bt4bbdLnPua5)
| [Week2](http://share.streamlit.io/0.19.0-qYak/index.html?id=G9AGybo1qFHPSfCmSy2hjn)
| [Week3](http://share.streamlit.io/0.23.0-2EMF1/index.html?id=8hMSF5ZV3Wmbg5sA3UH3gW)
| [Week4](http://share.streamlit.io/0.23.0-2CETv/index.html?id=JhGfWhy7Rgt4SGeuPVcsDZ)

2. ðŸŽ® **[Deep Q-Learning](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-examples/tree/master/deep_q_learning)**: In this project, we build reinforcement learning agents to tackle the environments of OpenAI Gym, including some classic Atari games! Here is a snapshot of what youâ€™ll create: [README](http://share.streamlit.io/0.23.0-2CETv/index.html?id=Mz9y9S9wgwU9DJBstrfEYx) | [Week1](http://share.streamlit.io/0.23.0-2CETv/index.html?id=5otPXhkjRTnQKWUVuwny3V) | [Week2](http://share.streamlit.io/0.23.0-2CETv/index.html?id=XyV3tEWEZQjfcZUp6k9gvJ) | Week3 | Week4 (Coming soon!)

If you are more interested in a supervised learning project, we recommend you start with the Movie Recommendation project.
If you are interested in reinforcement learning, we recommend the Deep Q-Learning project.

Enjoy!
