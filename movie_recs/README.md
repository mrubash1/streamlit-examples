# Movie Recommendation with Streamlit

In this guide, we walk you through the lifecycle of an Insight ML project. You
can think of this guide as a "making-of" Amber Robertâ€™s
[Project Orient](https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/Project-Orient).
Together, we will build a movie recommendation system using the
[MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset.

The project is broken into four parts, which correspond roughly to the weeks of
an Insight session.

1. **Exploring Data with Streamlit** - to better understand what we're working
with, we slice and dice and explore the MovieLens dataset.
2. **Recommendation System v0** - we build a naive recommendation system
end-to-end.
3. **Iterating on our recommendation system** - we experiment with two different
matrix factorization techniques to generate better recommendations.
4. **Running at scale** - we take our algorithm and scale it up! This time we
run it over a dataset that is 200X larger than in week 3!

## To Get Started

1. Go through the installation instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qo_MDz3iF0YRykuElF6I9WC4yAQIYzOA-GY16_NOuUM/edit?usp=sharing).

2. SSH into your AWS instance:

```shell
ssh streamlit-aws
```

3. On your AWS instance:

	i. Change directories into the sshfs directory and clone this repo:

	```shell
	cd sshfs
	git clone https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-examples
	```

	ii. Create the conda environment, which has all the libraries we need for this project (*this takes a few minutes*):  

	```shell
	cd streamlit-examples/movie_recs
	conda env create -f environment.yml
	```

	iii. Activate the conda environment that you just created:
	```shell
	source activate movie_recs
	```

4. On your local machine, in a terminal open this project in Atom:
	```shell
	atom ~/remote/streamlit-examples
	```

5. Back on your AWS instance:

	i. Change into the `src` directory and run week1_explore.py
	```shell
	cd src
	python week1_explore.py
	```

6. On your local machine, in Atom:

	i. Open `week1_explore.py`

	ii. `ctrl+option+o` (on mac) or `ctrl+alt+o` (on ubuntu) to open the Streamlit side pane.

	iii. Your screen should look like this at this point:

7. Next, follow the instructions in week1_explore.py. Enjoy!
